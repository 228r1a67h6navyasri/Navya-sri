In this project, I applied my Python skills to develop an interactive and user-friendly data visualization dashboard using Streamlit, Pandas, and Plotly. The goal was to create a dynamic tool that allows users to upload different types of datasets and instantly explore them through filtering, transformation, and visual analysis.

I began by using Streamlit to design the interface, configure the page layout, and build an intuitive sidebar for user interaction. The sidebar includes options for uploading files, selecting themes, applying filters, and choosing visualization types. I implemented file-handling logic using Python’s conditional statements to process multiple formats such as CSV, Excel, JSON, and text files. This demonstrated my ability to work with diverse data sources and handle exceptions through try–except blocks.

Using Pandas, I performed data loading, cleaning, and preprocessing. I identified numeric, categorical, and date columns using select_dtypes, enabling automated filter generation. I applied advanced filters such as text search, category-based selection, numeric sliders, and date range selection. These filtering features required strong knowledge of dataframe manipulation, boolean indexing, and data type conversion.

For data visualization, I used Plotly Express and Graph Objects to create a wide variety of interactive charts, including scatter plots, line charts, histograms, box plots, heatmaps, pie charts, bar charts, area charts, violin plots, and treemaps. I implemented dynamic chart rendering based on user selections, adjusting chart dimensions and color themes depending on the chosen mode (light or dark). This showcased my ability to work with visualization libraries and customize layouts using Python dictionaries and Plotly configurations.

Finally, I added features such as displaying filtered data, downloading CSV outputs, and resetting filters to enhance user experience. Overall, this work highlights my Python proficiency in data processing, visualization, UI development, and building end-to-end interactive analytical tools.
